            I'm 35, leaving near Bordeaux, France, with my beloved son and wife Marie-Hélène ( see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mon-horizon.com">Mon Horizon</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Graduate in physics, I began to be a serious developper during my PhD, making some ugly Fortran code to build nuclear matter models based on subnucleonic constituents. 
            For the braves: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theses.fr/2008BOR13604">thesis</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/find/nucl-th/1/au:+Huguet_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">publications</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2008, I design and develop software, I manage teams (mainly) technical. I am looking to contribute to business projects with beautiful people and values.
        </p>

    <h2>Manifesto</h2>

        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>
            In my daily life, at work, in the organisations I have been in, I see people wasting their time doing things in sub-optimal ways, or doing things which are useless. 
            If you can optimize organisations, work habits, if you can make that people spend less time doing stupind or repetitive things, people will benefit of that. 
            They can spend more time on things which creates more value, for them and for the organisation. 
            They can work less, be more comfortable at work, spending more time with their families. 
        </p>
        <p>
            People time is what is the most precious. We should not tolerate to let people waste their time.
        </p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            I build software to improve the daily lives of users, to improve organizations and create new dynamics of value creation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I promote a work organisation based on empathy, autonomy, trust, personal responsibility,  and high requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm constantly looking for learning and extending my confort zone. I contribute to the sharing of experiences and knowledge to promote the improvement of all.
